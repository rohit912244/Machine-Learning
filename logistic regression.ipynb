What are the key assumptions of Simple Linear Regression?\n","\n","Ans:\n","1. Linearity\n","\n","- The relationship between the independent variable (X) and dependent variable (Y) should be linear.\n","\n","That means changes in X lead to proportional changes in Y.\n","\n","- Check: Scatter plot of X vs. Y should show a roughly straight-line pattern.\n","\n","2. Independence of Errors\n","\n","- The residuals (errors) should be independent of each other.\n","\n","- In time series data, this means that residuals at one time point shouldn’t be correlated with those at another.\n","\n","- Check: Durbin–Watson test or residual plot.\n","\n","3. Homoscedasticity (Constant Variance of Errors)\n","\n","- The variance of the residuals should be constant across all values of X.\n","\n","- In other words, the spread of residuals should be roughly the same for all predicted values.\n","\n","- Check: Residuals vs. Fitted Values plot should show a random scatter (no funnel or pattern).\n","\n","4. Normality of Errors\n","\n","- The residuals (errors) should be normally distributed.\n","\n","- This assumption is especially important for hypothesis testing (like t-tests on coefficients).\n","\n","Check: Histogram or Q–Q plot of residuals.\n","\n","5. No (or Minimal) Measurement Error in X\n","\n","- The independent variable (X) should be measured without significant error.\n","\n","- Errors in X can bias the slope estimation.\n","\n"," 6. No Perfect Multicollinearity (only for multiple regression)\n","\n","- In Simple Linear Regression, this isn’t applicable because there’s only one predictor.\n","\n","- But it becomes important in Multiple Linear Regression (when there are multiple X variables)."],"metadata":{"id":"5GHg9PE5mKxt"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Q3.
